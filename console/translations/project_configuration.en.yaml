                To import content from a Wordpress site into this project, you first need to export
                the content of the Wordpress site in XML format.
                <br /><br />
                For this, in your Wordpress administration panel, open the Tools > Export option and click
                on Export All. You will then receive an email with an XML file containing all the pages and
                news from your website.
                <br /><br />
                Once you have received it, import this XML file into the form below.
            file:
                label: Wordpress export file in XML format
                error: An error has occurred, can you try again?

                        All public pages of the Wordpress site will be imported and published on your website.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can choose to import all the news as drafts, or to keep the
                        same status (published / draft) as on the Wordpress site.
                    </li>

                        Import the news while keeping their Wordpress status (published if the news was published
                        on Wordpress, draft otherwise)
