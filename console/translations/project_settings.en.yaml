            help: |
                The GDPR is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy.
                It creates rights for your visitors on how you process their
                data and what you can store about them. In order to exercise these
                rights, visitors need to know who to contact in your organization.
                The following details are thus meant to be used by visitors wanting to
                exercise their GDPR rights. You should probably provide the contact details
                of your legal department or your Data Protection Officer.
